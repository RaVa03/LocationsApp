<h1 align="center"> LocationsApp - A simple website using React & Express.js</h1>

<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am working on this project in my spare time, in order to improve my Web Development skills. The technlogies that I used are: React for front-end (with the Vite framework), Express.js for back-end and MongoDB as my database (using the Mongoose library).
<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the app is more back-end centered, the basic functionalities of CRUD being implemented (the user can add, view, edit and delete locations). Also, locations can be chosen as favorites, and all the favorites places can be viewed in a different page.
<br>

## Future plans
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to implement a comment section and authentication, so the user can only edit/ delete the content that was published by himself.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I am planning to polish the front-end part more, in order to create a better user experience.
